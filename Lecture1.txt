 Everything in javascript happens inside the execution context 
 Execution Context is like a big box everything happend inside this box.

Memory Component                |               Code Component
or Variable Environment                         or Thread Of Execution
       
      key:value                                 o     
      a : 10                                    ---------------
      fn : {....}                               o
                                                ----------------
